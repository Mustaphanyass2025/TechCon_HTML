            <h2>History of TechCon</h2>
            <p>TechCon began over a decade ago with a clear vision: to create a space where Africa’s brightest minds
                could come
                together and explore the rapidly evolving world of technology. What started as a small meetup among
                passionate
                developers has grown into a continental event attended by thousands.
                Today, TechCon serves as a launchpad for innovation, collaboration, and professional growth across the
                African tech
                ecosystem.</p>
